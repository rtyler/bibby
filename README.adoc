= Bibby

An extensible IRC bot framework that relies on inter-process communication
rather than plugins.

The idea is that commands are dispatched to configurable HTTP addon services
which do all the heavy lifting. This would allow shared services to be deployed
servicing multiple bot instances. Basically the "bot" part of bibby is a simple
dispatch loop, all the "smarts" are in the addon services.
